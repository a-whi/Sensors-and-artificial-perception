# TRC3500 - Sensors and artificial perception


Introduced the principles and performance characteristics of transducers and sensors, with a strong emphasis on practical implementation in robotic and embedded systems. Covered common sensor types, electronic components, and data acquisition, alongside digital signal processing and sensor integration.

Applied these concepts through hands-on projects including a blob detection system, barcode scanner, and an ultrasonic sensing system. Projects involved sensor interfacing, signal processing, and system integration using Python and C++, with hardware-based development on a PSoC microcontroller for ultrasonic sensing.
